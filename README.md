# Vote_turnout_prediction

# What We Did:
We implemented Voter Turnout Prediction using Machine Learning for your virtual voting platform.

# Why We Did It:
The goal was to predict voter turnout based on various factors such as age groups, weather, day of the week, previous turnout, and population density. This can help election officials or administrators plan resources better and improve voter engagement strategies.

# Step-by-Step Breakdown :-
# Step 1: Generating a Synthetic Dataset
Since we didnâ€™t have real-world voter turnout data, we generated a dataset with realistic features such as:

# Age groups: (18-25, 26-40, 41-60, 60+)

# Weather conditions: (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy)
Day of the week: (Weekday, Weekend)
Previous election turnout percentage

# Population density: (Urban, Rural)
Voter turnout percentage (Target variable, i.e., what we want to predict)
We saved this data into voter_turnout_data.csv so we could use it for model training.

# Step 2: Training the Machine Learning Model
We loaded the dataset and prepared it for training.

# Feature Engineering:
Converted categorical data (Weather, Day of the week, Population Density) into numbers because machine learning models work with numbers, not text.

# Model Selection:
We used the Random Forest Regressor, which is an ensemble learning method that works well for prediction tasks.

# Training:
We split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Trained the model using X (input features) and Y (voter turnout % as target).
Saved the trained model and feature columns for later use.

# Step 3: Making Predictions

Once the model was trained, we created a predictor script (predict_turnout.py).

# This script:
Loads the trained model.
Takes new election details as input (age groups, weather, etc.).
Predicts voter turnout percentage based on the input.

# Final Outcome

Now, given any new election conditions, our model can predict voter turnout.
This data can be displayed in the admin dashboard or used for decision-making in election management.
